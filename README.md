# Fire Emblem (Personal) Graphics Repository

------------ This is a public F2U and (sometimes) F2E repository of graphics for Fire Emblem ROM Modding.

------------ This repository contains: Portraits, battle animations, map sprites, music files, and other resources people might like to use.

------------ All battle animations are F2E. Many other resources are F2E, but some are only F2U. Not sure what that means? Check this thread for more info: https://feuniverse.us/t/regarding-graphics-assets/11550/5

------------ Note that if something is not listed as F2E, it's probably F2U. That being said. You can just assume a resource is F2U to be safe, but checking with the original creator for F2E 
permissions is preferable when unlisted.

------------ If you go inside any specific animation's folder, you will also find credits for that animation at the bottom.
